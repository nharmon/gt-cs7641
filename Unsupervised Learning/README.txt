=== Instructions  ===

  The following R packages are needed to run the programs:
      "caret", "cluster", "fastICA", "mclust", "neuralnet", 
      "nFactors", "gmodels"

  Each .R file should be run from RStudio but can be run from the 
  command line. If you need to install the previously mentioned 
  packages, it may be easier to load the programs into RStudio as 
  there are commands at the beginning of each program to install 
  the packages it needs. You just need to uncomment them.

  To run from the command line, simply:

      $ Rscript <program>
